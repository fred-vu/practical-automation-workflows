---

### 1. Candlestick Analysis:
- Trend: The recent candlestick pattern shows a series of bearish candles, although the current candle is green. The overall trend remains bearish in the short term.
- Significant Patterns: There appears to be a potential bullish hammer in the most recent candles, which may indicate a reversal.
- Key Zones: The price seems to be in a pullback from a previous support level around $100,000. A breakout above $104,000 could signal a potential reversal.

### 2. MACD Analysis:
- Current State: The MACD line is below the Signal line, indicating a bearish momentum. The lines are relatively flat, suggesting potential for a crossover if bullish momentum increases.
- Histogram: The histogram bars are negative but beginning to decrease in size, which could indicate diminishing bearish momentum.
- Divergences: No significant divergences noted at this moment.

### 3. Volume Analysis:
- Trends: Volume has increased slightly on recent bearish days, indicating support for the downward movement.
- Support for Movements: The small decline in volume today suggests indecision, which might lead to a reversal or a period of consolidation.
- Spikes: No drastic volume spikes suggesting whale activity or manipulation at present.

### 4. Support and Resistance Levels:
- Support: Key support is around the $100,000 level. A break below this would be significant.
- Resistance: Immediate resistance is around $104,000-$105,000. Breaking and holding above this could provide bullish momentum.

### 5. RSI Analysis:
- Current Reading: RSI is around 34.95, indicating the market is approaching oversold conditions. This can often precede a corrective move upward.
- Divergences: No clear bullish divergences, but the oversold condition could hint at a potential for buying interest.

### 6. Market Context:
- Broader Trend: The overall crypto market has been on a recent bearish trend, influenced by macroeconomic factors.
- News Impact: No specific news mentioned, but keep an eye on regulatory developments or major market announcements.

### 7. Actionable Insights:
- Strategy: Consider accumulating if the $100,000 support holds and the price confirms upward movement with increased volume.
- Watch For: Confirmation of a bullish reversal pattern (e.g., confirmation of the hammer) and volume support.
- Price Targets: Look to target around $107,000 for partial profit-taking, with a stop-loss slightly below $99,000 to mitigate risk.

### 8. Risk Assessment:
- Warning Signs: A close below $100,000 could accelerate a bearish trend.
- Confidence Level: Medium, given conflicting indicators and the broader market trend.
- Upcoming Events: Monitor any potential news around Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory changes, or macroeconomic shifts that might affect sentiment. 

This analysis suggests cautious optimism with strict risk management.
